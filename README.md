#insta[mood]
One of the ways humans cope with emotion is by talking to others. **insta[mood]** is a mobile-first app that aims to analyze true emotions, show the user that they're not alone, and connect people via chat.

Check out a walkthrough of our app here: https://youtu.be/N-kzZHl9nB4

Our current deployed version is here: http://lmk-instamood.herokuapp.com/

### Some Disclaimers

A walkthrough will be provided so you can experience the app, but for the time being, here are some hoops you have to jump through to use it:

1. Contact us to be added as a sandbox user on Instagram.
2. If you wish to use the Heroku deployment, then revert back to a Chrome browser version older than 50.
3. Otherwise, just fork and clone, and run from localhost:3000.

### Features

1. The **home page** gives a brief description of the app and signs you in via OAuth with Instagram.
2. Upon signing it, you'll land at the **mood page**. You'll see a larger photo featuring the most recent photo of you on instagram containing your face, a smaller picture of your profile pic and how you're feeling. If you aren't feeling what we've interpreted you as, feel free to choose from the other options.
3. Navigating to the **map page**, you'll see an orange dot which is your location. Surrounding you will be people that are near you featuring emojis depicting their mood.
4. Lastly, going to  **chat page** will bring up a chat room that you can join and talk to other people that are logged in.
